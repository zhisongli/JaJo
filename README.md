Julia and PyPlot
Since the moment I know the super fast speed of Julia, I decided to learn it and rewrite my code with it when time is convenien.
So a few fundermental tutorials were loaded and I even bought a book via kindle.
Every night, I read a few pages with my kindle before my dream. I did not start to write even a simle script until there is a frind 
who asked me to share here a computer language. I hurried up and wrote a few scripts to introduce julia's syntax for beginners. 
Luckly, I am familar with MATLAB and their syntax are almost identical. You can see the uploaded script, and it looks like a juLab (julia+MabLab).
