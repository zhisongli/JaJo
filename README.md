Julia and PyPlot
Since the moment I know the super fast speed of Julia, I decided to learn it and rewrite my code with it when time is convenien.
So a few fundermental tutorials were loaded and I even bought a book via kindle.
Every night, I read a few pages with my kindle before my dream. I did not start to write even a simle script until there is a frind 
who asked me to share here a computer language. I hurried up and wrote a few scripts to introduce julia's syntax for beginners. 
Luckly, I am familar with MATLAB and their syntax are almost identical. You can see the uploaded script, and it looks like a juLab (julia+MabLab).

In the following few week, I will share all the teaching scripts here. 
The function of every script is simple, however they can free you from being or goole. 
You won't feel regret by sparing time to my script written in JULIA.
